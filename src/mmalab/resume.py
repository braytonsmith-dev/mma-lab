"""
resume.py - Resume-first rating engine (who has earned it as of now).

Differences from the predictive Elo in elo.py:
  1. Decisions blend the judges' cards with the fight stats (card_weight = 0.5).
     Cards, per judge by point margin: 1 point (29-28, 48-47) = close, 0.6;
     2 points = 0.8; 3+ points (30-27, 49-46, 50-45) = 1.0; mean of three.
     Stats: logistic of the winner's dominance per minute. The official winner
     never scores below a draw, so a robbery (e.g. Jones-Reyes) earns the winner
     little and costs the loser little. Finishes score 1.0.
     "Dominant" needs the cards (2 of 3 at 3+ points) and the stats to agree.
  2. Loss protection, for losses to a division top-3 fighter or in a title fight:
       not dominant                      -> 15% of the normal drop
       dominant (2 of 3 cards 3+ points,
       or a round-one finish)            -> 75%
       round-one finish by a heavy
       favorite (>= 75% pre-fight)       -> 100%
     A loss right after another loss keeps at least 60% (streaks are not one-offs).
     A finish counts as dominant in round one, or early (first half of the scheduled
     rounds) when the loser was clearly behind on stats. A later finish of a fighter
     who was close on stats (winner ahead by 1.5 per minute or less) is a war.
  2b. Proof of concept: a close loss (split/majority decision, a decision scored
     0.70 or less, or a war finish) to a top-5 fighter by someone outside the top 5
     earns the loser a small gain (10% of K) instead of a loss.
  2c. A first-round finish by the underdog moves both ratings only 70% as much.
  3. No rating decay for layoffs. Inactivity is handled separately, with an
     injury exemption (config/layoffs.yaml).
  4. Records quality wins as they happen: opponent had >= 5 UFC wins, or was
     inside the division top 7 at fight time. Five or more = "entrenched".

Positions at fight time are computed from this same rating among fighters
active in the prior `active_days` in that division.
